Nuvoton NPCM Watchdog

Nuvoton NPCM timer module provides five 24-bit timer counters, and a watchdog.
The watchdog supports a pre-timeout interrupt that fires 10ms before the
expiry.

Required properties:
- compatible      : "nuvoton,npcm750-wdt" for NPCM750 (Poleg).
- reg             : Offset and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupts      : Contain the timer interrupt with flags for
                    falling edge.

Required clocking property, have to be one of:
- clocks          : phandle of timer reference clock.
- clock-frequency : The frequency in Hz of the clock that drives the NPCM7xx
                    timer (usually 25000000).

Optional properties:
- timeout-sec : Contains the watchdog timeout in seconds
- nuvoton,restart-priority - Contains the card restart priority.
- nuvoton,card-reset-type = "porst|corst|wd0|wd1|wd2|sw1|sw2|sw3|sw4"
  Contains the card reset type for checking and indicating 
  the last card reset status (WDIOF_CARDRESET)
  
  If 'nuvoton,card-reset-type' is not specified the default is porst

  Reset types:
       - porst: Power reset
       - corst: Core reset
	   - wdX : Watchdog reset X (X represante 0-2)
	   - swX : Software reset X (X represante 1-4)

- nuvoton,ext1-reset-type = "porst|corst|wd0|wd1|wd2|sw1|sw2|sw3|sw4"
  Contains the external 2 reset type for checking and indicating 
  the last external 2 reset status (WDIOF_EXTERN1)
  
  If 'nuvoton,card-reset-type' is not specified the default is wd0.
  
  Reset types are the same as in nuvoton,card-reset-type property.

- nuvoton,ext2-reset-type = "porst|corst|wd0|wd1|wd2|sw1|sw2|sw3|sw4"
  Contains the external 2 reset type for checking and indicating 
  the last external 2 reset status (WDIOF_EXTERN2)

  If 'nuvoton,card-reset-type' is not specified the default is sw1.
  
  Reset types are the same as in nuvoton,card-reset-type property.
	   
Example:

timer@f000801c {
    compatible = "nuvoton,npcm750-wdt";
    interrupts = <GIC_SPI 47 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
    reg = <0xf000801c 0x4>;
    clocks = <&clk NPCM7XX_CLK_TIMER>;
	nuvoton,restart-priority = <155>;
	nuvoton,card-reset-type = "porst";
	nuvoton,ext1-reset-type = "wd1";
	nuvoton,ext2-reset-type = "sw2";
};
